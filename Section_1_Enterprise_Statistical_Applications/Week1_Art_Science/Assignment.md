# Create a Business Case for Statistical Applications

For this assignment, you `will identify a specific organizational problem that could be addressed through statistical applications`, and you will `create a business case` (justification for why your problem is important and should be prioritized above other projects requiring resources) to support the need for the analysis.  For example, you might want to explore how a working team could be more efficient in their productivity or how your company could generate incremental revenue through better product design and/or advertising campaigns.  As such, you would want `to explain the problem, why it is important, and how it could be addressed through the use of statistical applications`. You can use the dataset provided for this assignment and all subsequent assignments, or you may use your own dataset.  `Whichever dataset you use, it should be used throughout the course` given that the assignments build upon prior assignments.

## Components of the business case

Your business case should consist of the following components:

- Description of the problem statement
- Justification as to why solving the problem is important, which should be connected to an organizational strategic initiative
- Explanation of how statistical applications could be used to solve the problem (e.g., how you would descriptively analyze your data and run statistical tests for hypothesis testing)
- Summary
