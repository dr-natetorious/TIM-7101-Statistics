# Create an Executive Presentation for Stakeholders

## Instructions

Now that you have created your strategic plan, the final step prior to implementing your plan is to prepare a presentation for your executive leadership team and other relevant stakeholders.

## Format

For this assignment, you must prepare a PowerPoint presentation, in which you will:

- Create an outlined version of your strategic plan. You will basically follow the same order as your document.  When working on presentations, you must synthesize the main components to be highlighted to higher management. Therefore, you must not dump the document contents into the slides. You must summarize in bullets with supporting figures and illustrations.
- Use one to two slides to discuss each phase or component of your strategic plan.
- Include notes in each section where you will write the narrative to follow when delivering the presentation.
- Remember your audience when you create this presentation. Your presentation should be professional in appearance and tone.
- Incorporate appropriate animations, transitions, and graphics for each slide.
- Add speaker notes to support the delivery of each slide. The speaker notes should hold the explanation part of your presentation and identify references, as needed. The speaker notes may be comprised of brief paragraphs or bulleted lists.  150-200 words per slide.

Use the Record Voice feature in PowerPoint to record your presentation of each slide in the presentation. You are not supposed to read the speaker notes to your audience, but instead, use the notes to help guide your presentation.

## Requirements

Length: 12-15 slides, not including title slide or references.

References:  Include a minimum of 5 scholarly resources.

The presentation should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course by providing new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. The content should reflect scholarly writing and current APA standards and should adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
