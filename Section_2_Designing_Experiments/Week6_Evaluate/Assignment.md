# Evaluate the Process of Statistical Application

For this assignment, you must write a reflection paper where you consider the process and outcomes achieved via your pilot study, and you will identify and articulate changes you would make if you were implementing a new large-scale imitative to foster continuous improvement within your organization.  Next, you should consider how you would align your plan to the larger organizational strategy.  This assignment will help build the foundation required to design your intervention in Week 7.  

Your paper must include two sections: (1) your reflection of the process and outcomes of the pilot; and (2) your proposed large-scale plan and its alignment to the larger organizational strategy.

Your evaluation should be based on the assumed value creation that can be achieved through a large-scale intervention.  When considering the value creation, consider the following:

- Review the original business case that you created in Week 1 and consider how the findings from your pilot study align with your original business case and the extent to which you were able to address your problem.
- Reflect on the process as well as the outcomes of the process.
- Determine changes needed to help the process best achieve your outcomes.
- Determine how you can best obtain stakeholder buy-in and alignment to move forward with a large-scale initiative.
