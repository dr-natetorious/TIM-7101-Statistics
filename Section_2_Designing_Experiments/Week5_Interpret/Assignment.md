# Interpret Statistical Output

Now that you have analyzed your data, you will need to interpret the output that you obtained from your data analysis. Specifically, you need to discuss what the data analysis findings mean in relation to your research questions and hypotheses, and what actions should be taken as a result. 

For this assignment, you must provide a narrative that discusses the key insights from your data analysis findings and highlights the limitations of your analysis.  Limitations should pertain to weaknesses in your design and limits on your ability to make conclusions.  For example, if you are not able to determine cause and effect, that would be a limitation. If your dataset is small, that would be another limitation.

Length: 5-7 pages, not including title and reference pages

References: Include a minimum of 5 scholarly resources.

The completed assignment should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course by providing new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. The content should reflect scholarly writing and current APA standards and should adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
